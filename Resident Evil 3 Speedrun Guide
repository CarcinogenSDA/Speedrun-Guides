Mediakite Version Troubleshooting
==================================
The fastest available version of Resident Evil 3 to run is Biohazard 3 Mediakite, which is a Japanese version. For legal reasons, I personally cannot tell you where to find it other than eBay or Amazon, as it is very hard to find.

1) Installation

ＰＬＡＣＥＨＯＬＤＥＲ

2) FPS Issues

FPS Issues are caused by the default option that Biohazard 3 chooses, which is RGB Emulation. Here's how you fix it:
-Run in compatibility mode for Windows XP.
-Hit F2 to enter the options menu.
-Under "Video", Select your primary graphics card driver, but choose the option that doesn't say "RGB Emulation". Change the resolution to 800x600 (「800 x 600　ピクセル」) and choose "Windowed".
-Under "Etc" turn off "Play Movie", "Texture Adjustment" and turn on "Texture interpolation".

3) Bio3 SRT by Dchaps
Bio3 SRT is a program written by Dchaps that reads the memory values of Biohazard 3 Mediakite and displays the Health, Boss Health, and In-Game Time. It can be found in the Resources section of Speedrun.com's Resident Evil 3 Page.

4) In-Game Time via Livesplit
Fatalis wrote a LiveSplit script that reads the In-Game Time for Biohazard 3 Mediakite. It can be found in the Resources section of Speedrun.com's Resident Evil 3 Page. 

==================================
Techniques
==================================
1) Attack Dodge (For 2 Cycle Grave Digger)
2) Quick Shot (Advanced)
3) Bite Knockback
4) No-Bite Shakeoff
5) Auto-Shove

==================================
Footspeed note, Free Heals, FAS Locations
==================================

Keeping your HP above 100 (Caution) is important for learning dodges and maintaining footspeed. Footspeed drops 10% when you are below 101 HP, and your turn radius sharply decreases, which decreases your chances of a successful dodge.

It is 10x better and easier to learn dodges, fail while trying, and heal afterward than it is to blast them out of your way. The reason for this is because you will have to spend time looking for more ammo (when you can incorporate burnable FASes in your inventory to get rid of at any time if they clutter your inventory) and because you will have more real attempts at practicing dodges mid-run. A bite + shove is more effective than a shotgun blast in most situations anyway.

==================================
Ammo Route (Grenade Any%)
==================================

It is fastest to use the Grenade Launcher against bosses. Always. The Magnum has a separate ammo pickup route and is a "for fun" category. Not for beginners.

If you do not get the Grenade Launcher in the RPD, do NOT pick up the Magnum unless you are going to run Magnum Any%. The Grenade Launcher spawns in the Power Station (behind one of the voltage doors) if it does not spawn in the RPD. Getting the Grenade Launcher at the power station WILL, however, lose you around 40 seconds. You do not need to reset if you don't get Grenade Launcher in the RPD.

While the gunpowder, ammo, and green herb spawns are random, it is important to note the following: if you do NOT find a specific gunpowder in one place, the same gunpowder spawn WILL be placed elsewhere. This is only important for Nemesis% and Magnum Any%.

For Grenade Any% however, the goal is to only use guaranteed static pickups.

ONLY use bullets on Bosses, as they are the only enemies that require you to kill them to pass event triggers.

1) Grenade Launcher (6 Grenades)
2) Flame Rounds from Carlos (6 Flame)
3) Freeze Rounds from Carlos (6 Freeze)
4) Use 6 Freeze, 5 Flame on Nemesis @ Clock Tower
5) Grenades on corpse in Spooder Hallway
6) Pick up B, B, A before Grave Digger, when getting/using the pipe. Combine A + B to make C, combine C with B and mix with the Reload Tool to get 10 Acid Rounds. Exclusively for Grave Digger.
7) Grenades on shelf before Grave Digger
8) AAA in Dead Factory, combine with 6 Grenades to get 18 Flame
